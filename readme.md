Automatic Extraction of Causal-Consequences Relations
=====================================================

Identification of causality is not a trivial problem. Causation can
occur in various forms. Two common differentiations are made on:

-   **Marked and Unmarked causality** (a)
-   **Implicit and Explicit causality** (b)

Marked Causality is where there is a linguistic signal of causation
present.

For example, **“I attended the event because I was invited”**. Here,
causality is marked by **because**. On the other hand in **“Drive
slowly. There are potholes”**, causality is unmarked.

Explicit Causality is where both cause and effect are stated. For
example, **“The burst has been caused by water hammer pressure”** has
both cause and effect stated explicitly.

However, “The car ran over his leg” does not have the effect of the
accident explicitly stated.

Automatic extraction of cause-effect relations are primarily based on
three different approaches namely, **Linguistic rule based**,
**supervised** and **unsupervised** machine learning approaches.

The architecture uses word level embeddings and other linguistic
features to detect causal events and their effects mentioned within a
sentence. The extracted events and their relations are used to build a
causal-graph after clustering and appropriate generalization, which is
then used for predictive purposes.
